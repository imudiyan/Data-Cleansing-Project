# Data Cleansing Project (SQL)

## Hosing Data for data Cleansing
Imported the attached Excel data into SQL Server for data cleansing, an essential step in the data analysis process. SQL Server provides a robust platform for efficiently cleaning and preparing data. The data cleansing steps and corresponding scripts are outlined below:

-	Developed queries to identify missing and anomalous data.
-	Checked for NULL values in the Property Address column and corrected them.
-	Split the Property Address and Client Address fields to enhance data usability for analysis.
-	Standardized values in the SoldAsVacant column, ensuring only "Y" and "N" were used.
-	Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
