# Data Cleansing Project (SQL)

## Housing Data for Data Cleansing
This project focuses on data cleansing using SQL. The provided Excel dataset was imported into SQL Server, where essential data cleaning processes were performed to ensure accuracy and consistency. SQL Server offers a powerful platform for efficiently preparing data for analysis. The data cleansing steps and corresponding scripts are outlined below:

-	Developed queries to identify missing and anomalous data.
-	Checked for NULL values in the Property Address column and corrected them.
-	Split the Property Address and Client Address fields to enhance data usability for analysis.
-	Standardized values in the SoldAsVacant column, ensuring only "Y" and "N" were used.
-	Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
